Meeting with Alan for issue #1007


Overview:
Icons broke 2 years ago, changed to 'Lab icons', they made workaround in the mean time.


Information/Notes:

We want the new function to return the html-element

Look at index 67, has some use for lab-Icons

.element() puts icon  into Dom element

.react() creates an react-element to be placed somewhere (use in render)



Action Items:
Find which calls to displayname are actually rendered.

look into LabIcon calls
